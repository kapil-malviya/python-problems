Problem 1 :

Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out who has
the sent the greatest number of mail messages. The program looks for 'From '
lines and takes the second word of those lines as the person who sent the mail.
The program creates a Python dictionary that maps the sender's mail address to
a count of the number of times they appear in the file. After the dictionary is
produced, the program reads through the dictionary using a maximum loop
to find the most prolific committer.

Solution :  occurrence-of-mailid.py

Data : mbox-short.txt

Problem 2 : 

Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out
the distribution by hour of the day for each of the messages.
You can pull the hour out from the 'From ' line by finding the time and then
splitting the string a second time using a colon.

Once you have accumulated the counts for each hour, print out the counts,
sorted by hour as shown below.

Solution : hours-occurrence.py

Data : mbox-short.txt
