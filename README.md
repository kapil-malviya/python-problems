## Problem: Email Data Analysis

In the "Email Data Analysis" problem, we analyze a dataset containing information about various emails, their senders, 
timestamps, and other relevant data. The specific tasks to be performed were:

1. Counting the frequency of email senders to determine how many times each sender sent an email.
2. Identifying the hour of the day when the most emails were sent or received.

To view the detailed problem statement, refer to the provided Python script in the repository.
